# UniGenVR  
A set of tools for making VR experiences for Generic VR devices.  

# Intro  
GearVR and Daydream devices offer great input support through their controllers. Generic headsets only support gaze based input with limited interaction using Bluetooth/USB joysticks.  

In this repository:  
- The VR Samples project from Unity Technologies is modified  
- Uses [Unity.GVR.InstantPreview](https://github.com/adrenak/Unity.GVR.InstantPreview) for helping test in the editor.  
- Teleport using long trigger key press  

# Soon  
- Support for "walking" in VR using joystick or using gaze if controller is absent  
- More UI components such as the already existing SelectionSlider
