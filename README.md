# UniGenVR  
A set of tools for making VR experiences for Generic VR devices.  

# Intro  
GearVR and Daydream devices offer great input support through their controllers. Generic headsets only support gaze based input with limited interaction using Bluetooth/USB joysticks.  

In this repository:  
- The VR Samples project from Unity Technologies is beign modified for use with Gaze based interaction.  
- The GoogleVR SDK is currently only used for the Instant Preview feature. This helps circumvent the requirement for making an editor emulator.  

# Soon  
- Support for "walking" in VR using joystick or using gaze if controller is absent  
- More UI components such as the already existing SelectionSlider
